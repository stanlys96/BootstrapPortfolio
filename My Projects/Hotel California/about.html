        <p>And still those voices are calling from far away.
          Wake you up in the middle of the night.
          Just to hear them say.
          Welcome to the Hotel California.
          Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place).
          Such a lovely face.
          They livin' it up at the Hotel California.
          What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise).
          Bring your alibis.
          Mirrors on the ceiling
          The pink champagne on ice.
          And she said "We are all just prisoners here, of our own device".

        <p>On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair.
          Warm smell of colitas, rising up through the air.
          Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light.
          My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim.
          I had to stop for the night.
          There she stood in the doorway.
          I heard the mission bell.
          And I was thinking to myself.
          "This could be Heaven or this could be Hell"
          Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way.
          There were voices down the corridor.
          I thought I heard them say.</p>

        <p>Welcome to the Hotel California.
          Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place).
          Such a lovely face.
          Plenty of room at the Hotel California.
          Any time of year (Any time of year).
          You can find it here.
          
          Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, she got the Mercedes bends.
          She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys she calls friends.
          How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat.
          Some dance to remember, some dance to forget.
